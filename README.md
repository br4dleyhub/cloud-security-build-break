# Cloud Security Build & Break Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates a common cloud security vulnerability (IDOR)
by building a mobile-to-cloud file upload system, exploiting the flaw,
and then applying secure cloud design principles to fix it.

## Learning Goals
- Understand cloud identity and access control
- Learn how IDOR vulnerabilities appear in cloud systems
- Practice offensive and defensive security thinking
- Apply ethical security testing methods

## Tech Stack
- Python
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon S3
- AWS IAM
- Simple Python-based client interface

## Ethical Notice
This project is conducted in a personal AWS environment for educational purposes only.

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrated a real-world cloud security vulnerability (IDOR),
its exploitation, and a secure design fix.

It emphasizes the importance of authorization, not just authentication,
in cloud-based systems.
